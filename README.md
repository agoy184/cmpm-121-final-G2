## Tools and materials
### Engine
We intend to use Phaser, since everyone on our team took CMPM 120, so we already have experience with using Phaser. It’s also built for making web games, and quickly making prototypes, which is perfect for this project.

### Language
We are using JavaScript since it’s what we’ve used for our previous Phaser projects, and so we already have a lot of sample code we can reuse and rework to quickly implement the design requirements and focus on polishing and refactoring our code.

### Tools
The tools we expect to use are VScode, GitHub, Prettier, and ChatGPT.  VScode is a simple choice due to it being very compatible with the Phaser engine, which we intend to use.  GitHub is also an easy choice, as it’s the best platform for code management and version control.  Prettier will be a useful tool to keep our code format consistent and easy to read.  ChatGPT, while likely not being the main crux of writing code for our project, will be used for debugging.  


## Outlook
### Accomplishment Goals
Our team is hoping to accomplish the creation of a farming game that utilizes tilemaps and grid-based inventories for farming.  We also hope to accomplish a quality level of game feel by utilizing Phaser’s particle emitter system.  

### Hardest/Riskiest Part
We anticipate that the hardest part of the project will be having to change our implementation of core elements of our game due to the changing requirements. We also anticipate that maintaining a good design in order to easily add future design requirements may be difficult.

### Hoping to learn
We are hoping to learn how to quickly refactor our code to make future code changes easier to perform, which will be made significantly easier with the tools we chose, since we are already familiar with them. For us, the challenge won’t be learning the tools we use, but the actual core of the project and its changing requirements.
