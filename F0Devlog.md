## How we satisfied the software requirements
[F0.a] You control a character moving on a 2D grid.

[F0.b] You advance time in the turn-based simulation manually.

[F0.c] You can reap (gather) or sow (plant) plants on the grid when your character is near them.

[F0.d] Grid cells have sun and water levels. The incoming sun and water for each cell is somehow randomly generated each turn. Sun energy cannot be stored in a cell (it is used immediately or lost) while water moisture can be slowly accumulated over several turns.

[F0.e] Each plant on the grid has a type (e.g. one of 3 species) and a growth level (e.g. “level 1”, “level 2”, “level 3”).

[F0.f] Simple spatial rules govern plant growth based on sun, water, and nearby plants (growth is unlocked by satisfying conditions).

[F0.g] A play scenario is completed when some condition is satisfied (e.g. at least X plants at growth level Y or above).


## Reflection

### How has the team’s plan changed?
So far the team's plan hasn't necessarily changed, as we are laying a base foundation for our game's mechanics. We have not yet reached a point where our team has had to change course for what our finished game will look like.

### Did you reconsider any of the choices you previously described for Tools and Materials or your Roles?
We have not reconsidered our choices regarding tools or materials, as all of the currently established tools and materials are satisfactory with all of the current requirements.
